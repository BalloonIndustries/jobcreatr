Known issues
------------

### Wrong credentials

You have to get your credentials from the Commerce Guys Marketplace (https://marketplace.commerceguys.com/service/jirafe). The dashboard won't track data if you got your credentials from Jirafe website.

### Site removed

If you submit the configuration on another environment (domain or URL), the site might be recreated on Jirafe site and you might loose the tracked data.
